# Tuesday Lab: Git Practice and Deployment

1. We are going to pretend our individual computers are servers today.
2. On Thursday, you will each have your own server to work on deployments with (Thanks to the Research Computing Group at MU)
3. We are going to focus on the use of .git and the creation of virtual environments. 
	- Python virtualenv 
	- git clone
	- combining the two for deployments

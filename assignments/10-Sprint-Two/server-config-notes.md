# Make sure: 
1. Cloned Augur
2. Have it built with `make install` ... and when in doubt: `make rebuild` (if you have an augur.config.json present it will just rebuild everything to make sure it works.)
3. Make sure you have your virtual environment activated
4. Make sure your venv is python 3 `python --version` will affirm this
5. Make sure your server can see itself: `ping 129.114.104.229` (YOUR IP, not this sample!)
6. Edit `augur.config.json` to have my external ip in place. Make "host" be the EXTERNAL IP address of your computer:
```
    "Server": {
        "cache_expire": "3600",
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": "5000",
        "workers": "4"
    },
```
7. `make rebuild`
8. `make dev`
9. (Chrome works for sure. Some version of Firebox block 'cross site calls' on these servers we are using.) Firefox error in developer console: 
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8080/sockjs-node/info?t=1573159165913. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).
```
10. Create your postgres Database if you have not already: 
```
    sudo -u postgres 
    psql
    postgres=# create database augur;
    postgres=# create user augur with encrypted password 'mypass';
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database augur to augur;
```
11. However, your machines should already have an empty augur database available.
```
postgres=# create database augur;
ERROR:  database "augur" already exists
postgres=# create user augur with encrypted password 'mypass';
ERROR:  role "augur" already exists
postgres=# grant all privileges on database augur to augur;
GRANT
postgres=# set search_path to augur;
SET
postgres=# \dt
Did not find any relations.
postgres=# \q
postgres@js-104-143:~$ 
```
**so**, what you do is specify `localhost` for the server, `5432` for the port and `augur` for the database. Your username is `augur` and your password is `mypass`. 


## Want to start over and build augur again from scratch?
1. delete your `augur.config.json`
2. rerun `make install`

## Check open ports
1. Check what ports are being used: `sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN`
2. 


## Check if your firewall is disabled
sudo ufw status

## API Endpoints with only Five Repos

## Run the Dev Server: 
`make dev`

# Sprint 2

## Basics
1. All submissions in the GitHub repository created for you for this class. 
2. Your primary objective in this sprint is to get something working and deployed. 
    - We will cover Augur deployment on your servers in class on Thursday this week. 
    - Tuesday, you will need to be in your teams and decide what you are going to prototype. 
3. The goal is to get something *working* and *deployed*. That something should be an elementary, early version of something you want to build. _Something_ is defined as a metrics display, a new endpoint, or discernible progress on back end work (mostly these are individual projects). 
4. Create a "sprint-2" folder in your Augur repositories. In that folder place: 
    - A README.md file that explains what you are doing in this sprint, and provides a detailed description of the intended design. "Detailed" should keep in mind that you are building something that is "in addition to" the base code that you have to work with, so you do not need to specify/design the system. Only your intended additions to it. 
    - Make changes to this document as you work so that your progress can be monitored by your team mates. 
5. Ensure that everyone on  your team has a their own branch on your repository. 
6. Turn in a public link where your project will be working. We assume we can see the code in your GitHub repos. 

## Full Stack Teams
1. Identify three work items you will deploy as your "hello world" this week. These should include at least 1 UI component and one API component. 

## API Teams
1. Identify 3 APIs that you will build for the project. Submit those for review via slack to Dr. Goggins by Thursday morning. 
2. Decide on what the routes.py stubs will be for these endpoints and implement them 
3. Implement one endpoint fully. It does not have to be correct at this point. 

## Individual Teams
1. Make a commit to your repository illustrating progress on the issue or issues you have selected. 
2. Make an appointment with Dr. Goggins to review your selected issue.

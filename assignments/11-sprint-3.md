# Sprint 3 

## Basics
1. All submissions in the GitHub repository created for you for this class. 
2. Your primary objective in this sprint is to get a first iteration of your complete project deployed. 
4. Create a "sprint-3" folder in your Augur repositories. In that folder place: 
    - A README.md file that explains what you are doing in this sprint, and provides a detailed description of the intended design. 
    - "Detailed" should keep in mind that you are building something that is "in addition to" the base code that you have to work with, so you do not need to specify/design the system. Only your intended additions to it. 
    - Make changes to this document as you work so that your progress can be monitored by your team mates. 
5. Ensure that everyone on  your team has a their own branch on your repository. Everyone should make their individual contributions in their branch, then merge into the production (or master) branch at the end of the sprint. 
6. Turn in a public link where your project will be working. We assume we can see the code in your GitHub repos. **YOU ONLY NEED IT DEPLOYED ON ONE SERVER PER GROUP**
7. **Make any additions or updates requested by Sean and Caleb to your sprint 1 and 2 deliverables.**

## Full Stack Teams
1. Deploy working versions of your entire app in "beta form". Things can be "broken", but everything should be as functional as possible. This is your second to last sprint! 
2. For Front end: If you are working in your own web app and not deploying the front end in Augur the expectations are that your design will be more highly functional than if you put it inside Augur. Basically, you can choose the complexity of building it in Augur, or the complexity of delivering a more impressive front end than what you see in Augur. Honestly, this should not be too hard. 
3. Write tests for the API endpoints you developed. Follow the pattern in Augur for these tests. You can see several in the tests.py files. 

## API Teams
1. Complete the 3 APIs that you will build for the project. 
2. Write tests for the API endpoints you developed. Follow the pattern in Augur for these tests. You can see several in the tests.py files. 

## Frontend Teams
1. Implement the 3 front end designs that you will build for the project. 
2. Decide where each proposed new front end piece will fit in the Augur design. You don't have to put it directly in Augur right now, but you should think about where it fits in the overall information architecture.

## Individual Teams
1. Make a commit to your repository illustrating progress on the issue or issues you have selected. 
2. You must **Make an appointment with Dr. Goggins to review your selected issue.**. Friday is the preferred date this week.
